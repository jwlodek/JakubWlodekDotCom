        <h3>Focus Stacked 3D Reconstruction</h3>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FdpdAdoirwA" frameborder="0" allow="" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>During an internship at Brookhaven National Laboratory, I wrote software
            that used focus stacking as a way of collecting high quality images with a shallow depth of field
            fixed microscope, as well as recreating three dimensional depth data. The video to the left shows some of my results.
            It is the result of collecting 18 images of a mineral with a 5x microscope at a shallow depth of focus.
            The images were then merged into one, to create a single in-focus image. Finally, using OpenGL, the merged image,
            along with depth information that was collected simultaneously was used to generate the 3D model.
            This project is discussed further in my publications which can be found in the Resume/CV portion of this website.

        <img src="assets/RowersMeet.png" alt="Rowers Meet Homepage" />
        <p>For my principles of database systems course at Stony Brook University, I worked as part of a small team to create
            a dating website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap for the front end portion, and Java and MySQL for the 
            website backend. We used .jsp files and servlets to integrate the html with the output of the jdbc based SQL queries,
            and we hosted the completed website on an Apache server. Source code for the project is available on my Github account.
