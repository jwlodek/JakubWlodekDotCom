                <p>As a way to add comprehensive OpenCV functionality to the EPICS areaDetector project, I worked on writing a plugin
                    that allows for implementing additional CV features while using the same, modular, EPICS backbone. The project relies
                    on shared Input/Output parameters that can be used by whichever function is currently selected. The descriptions for these
                    input and output parameters are updated in real time to the ones tied to whichever function is in use. In addition, the plugin
                    provides image passthrough to allow for standard image output when the plugin is not in use. Currently, there are 10 OpenCV functions
                    implemented, including Canny and Laplacian edge detection, Centroid identification, object identification, real-time image subtraction
                    and masking, sharpening, and distance computation. In addition, thanks to the plugin's modular design,
                    new functionality requires only one additional function to be written,
                    with an already existing template in place if a single new use case is desired. The plugin is also fully interoperable with the remaining
                    suite of areaDetector plugins, and is thus simple to integrate into any workflow. ADCompVision has been integrated into the main
                    areaDetector repository, and thus sources can be seen on <a href = "https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCompVision">Github</a>.

            <p>During my internship at Brookhaven National Laboratory, I constructed software that used focus stacking as a
                way of collecting high quality images with a shallow depth of field fixed microscope, as well as recreating
                three dimensional depth data. The images to the left show some of my results. The two sets of images were the result of collecting
                18 images of a mineral, and 38 images of a horse fly with a 5x microscope at a shallow depth of focus. The images were then merged into
                one, to create a single in-focus image. This can be seen with the two included images of the fly, with the top of the two
                being a raw image from the stack that exhibits large out-of-focus regions, and the lower image shows the results attained after merging the
                stack of 38 into a single image. Finally, using OpenGL, the merged image, along with depth information
                that was collected simultaneously, was used to generate a 3D model of the sample. An example of a generated depth map
                for thge mineral is also shown on the left. This project has resulted in three co-authored
                publications, one of which, "Achieving 3D imaging through focus stacking," is linked above. 
                Additionally, reconstructed model 3D videos have been uploaded to the youtube channel linked above.

            <p>In order to gain support for USB Video Class (UVC) devices for the EPICS area detector software suite, I developed a custom driver
                using the libusb and libuvc libraries. The current driver is available in beta version R0-1. Most of the core camera functions have
                already been implemented, including image streaming and acquisition, image size and framerate control, and interoperability with
                area detector plugins ranging from file saving to image processing. UVC cameras range from cheap consumer webcams to high quality 
                industrial cameras, giving them a wide breath of use cases. Some primary use cases include test benches for further plugin development
                (because of the simplicity of their setup), monitoring (because of their inexpensiveness), and use in small form factors (they are 
                available in a variety of sizes and shapes including pencil cameras).

            <p>As a way to simplify sample managment at National Synchrotron Light Source II beamlines, I worked on constructing
                a barcode reader plugin for the area detector project (A link to the areaDetector github page can be found
                in the footer of this site). The plugin integrated the opencv and zbar libraries for image processing and
                barcode detection respectively, and wrote detected barcode messages into Process Variables, or PVs. Database
                integration is the next piece of the puzzle, and current work is focused on adding built in support for MySQL
                and MongoDB databases, with more specialized solutions being added later. The flexibility of this solution,
                however, lies in the fact that barcode/QR code information is stored in PVs, which can be accessed through
                a variety of methods including through a shell script or a python program, meaning that regardless of the
                database implementation in use at a particular beamline, even if the plugin itself doesn't natively support
                it, intergating it should not be difficult.
