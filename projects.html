            <p>As a fan of command-line user interfaces, I decided to construct a library that allows for widget-based interface construction, using 
                only ascii characters in python. Usage-wise, py_cui is modelled after Tkinter, and relies on a grid-based layout. It supports
                most typical widget types, including labels, buttons, text boxes, and scroll menus/check boxes. It also supports popups of all kinds,
                including loading bars and icons. It is available to download with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/py-cui/" >pip</a>, and has sources on <a href="https://github.com/jwlodek/py_cui">Github</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Using py_cui, I have constructed two applications to demo the libraries abilities. <a href="https://github.com/jwlodek/pyautogit">PyAutoGit</a>,
                is a command-line interface for working with multiple git repositories at once. It is pictured in action to the right, pushing to the repository
                that powers this website. I also made <a href="https://github.com/jwlodek/py_cui_2048">py_cui_2048</a>, a simple 2048 clone that runs in your terminal.</p>
            <p>The library is cross platform, working on windows and linux, and the development is helped by automated unit testing through Travis CI, as well as
                by automated documentation construction. It is still in a beta phase, and future work is planned to add more widgets and features.

            <p style="width:75%;">In order to improve string manipulation in C (splitting in particular), I wrote a small single header C library that contains some useful
                functions that allow for python-like string operations.</p>
            <p style="width:75%;">An example of csplit's python like usage would passing an index
                of negative one to a function in order to perform the function starting from the end of the string. Csplit provides functions for splitting on characters or
                other strings, has support for performing these operations from the front or rear of the string, and adds support for other useful functions like strip(), startswith()
                and endswith(). The primary data structure used by csplit is a doubly-linked list called a CSplitList, and is composed of CSplitFragments. Essentially, csplit abstracts
                splitting C strings away replacing the archaic strtok, at the cost of some memory. I have used csplit in several other personal projects with success. It currently has 24
                stars on Github.

                <p>As a way to add comprehensive OpenCV functionality to the EPICS areaDetector project, I worked on writing a plugin
                    framework that allows for implementing a variety of OpenCV real-time image processing features while using the same, modular, EPICS backbone.</p>
                    <p>The project allows for OpenCV functions to be called in real time on images recieved from any areaDetector camera driver,
                        and for the processed images to be pushed to other areaDetector plugins. Currently, there are 10 OpenCV functions
                    implemented, including Canny and Laplacian edge detection, Centroid identification, object identification, real-time image subtraction
                    and masking, sharpening, and distance computation. In addition, thanks to the plugin's modular design,
                    new functionality requires only one additional function to be written,
                    with an already existing template in place if a single new use case is desired. </p>
                    <p>
                    ADCompVision has been used in several projects, including as a way to perform real time image subtraction for attaining dual threshold
                    images from the X-Spectrum Lambda detector, and as a way to identify sample centroids for pre-experimental alignment (see image). 
                    ADCompVision is integrated into the main
                    areaDetector repository, and thus sources can be seen on <a href = "https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCompVision">Github</a>.

            <p>During my internship at Brookhaven National Laboratory, I constructed software that used focus stacking as a
                way of collecting high quality images with a shallow depth of field fixed microscope, as well as recreating
                three dimensional depth data.</p>
                <p>The images to the left show some of my results. The two sets of images were the result of collecting
                18 images of a mineral, and 38 images of a horse fly with a 5x microscope at a shallow depth of focus. The images were then merged into
                one, to create a single in-focus image. The results can be seen to the left with the two included images of the fly. The top of the two
                images was taken directly from the stack and exhibits large out-of-focus regions, while the lower image shows the results attained after merging the
                stack of 38 images into a single output. Finally, using OpenGL, the merged image, along with depth information
                that was collected simultaneously, was used to generate a 3D model of the sample. An example of a generated depth map
                for the mineral is also shown on the left.</p>
                <p>This project has resulted in three co-authored
                publications, one of which, "Achieving 3D imaging through focus stacking," is linked above. 
                Additionally, reconstructed model 3D videos have been uploaded to the youtube channel linked above.

                <p>For the final project for my Software Engineering course, I was tasked with building a web app for political canvassing. Working with three other students, we discussed, designed, and finally developed the app with a Java and MySQL database back end, and an
                    html, css, and jsp front end. Some other technologies used were the Google maps API, Github for centralized version control,
                    and Apache Tomcat for running the app on a server.
                </p>
                    <p>SAVJ-Canvassing allows for creating campaigns with a given set of target
                        canvassing addresses, which are then algorithmically assigned to an available Canvasser based on his or her schedule, workload, and 
                        proximity. The Google Maps API is called via javascript for navigation to each destination by Canvassers, and a custom implementation of a Heuristic
                        solution to the travelling salesman problem is used to determine which order is best for visiting all locations.

            <p>In order to gain support for USB Video Class (UVC) webcam devices for the EPICS area detector software suite, I developed a custom driver
                using the libusb and libuvc libraries. The driver implements most camera functionality including Exposure Time, Saturation, and Framerate, and
                supports both 8-bit and 16-bit output modes.</p>
            <p>The current driver is available in version R1-2. It has been deployed on 3 beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS2),
                with the 17BM beamline currently having 7 devices in production as their main acquisition hardware, along with several more deployments 
                planned. ADUVC has been tested with all areaDetector plugins, and has been used in tandem with several to perform real time data analysis
                on budget hardware.</p>
            <p>UVC cameras range from cheap consumer webcams to high quality 
                industrial cameras, giving them a wide breath of use cases. Some current use cases include test benches for further plugin development
                (because of the simplicity of their setup), monitoring (because of their inexpensiveness), and use in small form factors (they are 
                available in a variety of sizes and shapes including pencil cameras). The average deployed ADUVC camera at NSLS2 costs under 100 $, while a
                comparable industrial GigE device (though obviously providing more features) could cost upwards of 700 or 800 $, often more.

                <p>As part of the centralized areaDetector build project, I wrote a python module called installSynApps that is responsible for cloning, building, and
                    packaging EPICS, synApps, and areaDetector with one command. In addition, using installSynApps, Dockerfiles were created for automatically 
                    creating release packages of EPICS and areaDetector on various architectures and linux distributions.
                </p>
                <p>installSynApps is written as an MVC (Model, View, Controller) application, with strict divisions between the data model, the driver code, and the user interface. As a result,
                    using the same back end code base, installSynApps supports a GUI version along with a CLI version that can be fully automated for scripting use. The GUI version
                    allows users to fully control their build, editing all version numbers and included modules.
                </p>
                <p>Once installSynApps could build and package EPICS and areaDetector, the goal of the project shifted to fully automate the process, and for this Docker containers were
                    utilized. Containers for each supported OS, architecture, and linux distribution are generated, and then installSynApps is run through a script inside the 
                    Docker container. This process will eventually be moved onto a CI server that will automatically generate release packages when new versions of core software modules are released.

                    <p>Working with two of my peers, I created a JavaScript based web game based on the Phaser WebGL game engine, with all original artwork.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through the Ages is a game inspired by one of Rare's early titles - Jetpac. The player must collect items that are critical to the character's (Gareth's) survival.
                        The player can carry one item at a time, and must carry it back to his base, avoiding enemies. Once all items are collected, the player advances to the next
                        level, or age.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through the Ages was written with a game design that allowed large amounts of code reuse between levels. In addition, enemy AI is state based, and gains access
                        to a greater amount of states as the game progresses, making subsequent levels more challenging. Through the Ages was a finalist at the 2019 Stony Brook 
                        University game programming competition. You may play the game yourself by clicking on the link above, or see the source code on Github.

                            a dating website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap for the front end, and Java and MySQL
                            for the website backend. We used .jsp files and servlets to integrate the html with the output of the jdbc

                        <p>Rower's Meet required handling profiles, location based data, and the arrangment dates between profiles. In addition,
                            it was required that similar profies be "matched", so that they may initiate a date. The source code for Rower's Meet

            <p>As a way to simplify sample managment at National Synchrotron Light Source II beamlines, I worked on constructing
                a barcode reader plugin for the area detector project.</p>
                <p>ADPluginBar uses the opencv and zbar libraries for image processing and
                barcode detection respectively, and writes detected barcode messages into Process Variables, or PVs. Database
                integration is the next step, and current work is focused on adding built in support for MySQL
                and MongoDB databases, with more specialized solutions being added later. ADPluginDmtx is an extension of ADPluginBar,
            and adds bindings to the libdmtx library, and data matrix barcode decode support.</p>
                <p>The flexibility of this solution,
                however, lies in the fact that barcode/QR code information is stored in EPICS PVs, which can be accessed through
                a variety of methods including through a shell script or a python program, meaning that regardless of the
                database implementation in use at a particular beamline, even if the plugin itself doesn't natively support
                it, integrating it should not be difficult.</p>
                <p>ADPluginBar and ADPluginDmtx are being tested for production use on several NSLS2 beamlines, and will likely
                    be used primarily for robotic automation of sample mangement.
