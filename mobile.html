        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Jakub Wlodek, and I am a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics 
            double major at Stony Brook University, currently in my senior year. I work at Brookhaven National
            Laboratory as a student assistant for the controls group at the National Synchrotron Light Source II. My work primarily
            revolves around writing Computer Vision based tools for scientists, along with developing new plugins and detector
            drivers for the open source area detector project. If you would like to learn more about these projects, make sure
            to visit the "Projects" page, and visit github for source code. Outside of work and school, I have a passion for all things technological, and I also 
            greatly enjoy spending time outside or on the water. In fact, I even row on the Stony Brook University Crew team.</p>
